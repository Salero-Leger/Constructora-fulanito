# 🌐 TOP-Landing Page

**TOP-Landing Page** is a project I created to **practice and demonstrate my skills** after completing the HTML and CSS modules.

In this project, I built a web page using the **basic semantic structure** of HTML, including:
`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`.

Then, I added styles with **CSS**, focusing on:
- Margin and padding control  
- Color and typography  
- Overriding default **user stylesheet** elements  

The most important part of this project was the **layout**, which I built entirely using **pure Flexbox** to manage alignment, spacing, and structure.

I’ve attached both the **HTML** and **CSS** files below in case I missed mentioning any detail.
